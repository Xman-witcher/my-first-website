 <img src="77.jpg" alt=""> <p>Linear data structure: Data structure in which data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly, where each element is attached to its previous and next adjacent elements, is called a linear data structure.
Examples of linear data structures are array, stack, queue, linked list, etc.
Static data structure: Static data structure has a fixed memory size. It is easier to access the elements in a static data structure.
An example of this data structure is an array.
Dynamic data structure: In dynamic data structure, the size is not fixed. It can be randomly updated during the runtime which may be considered efficient concerning the memory (space) complexity of the code.
Examples of this data structure are queue, stack, etc.
Non-linear data structure: Data structures where data elements are not placed sequentially or linearly are called non-linear data structures. In a non-linear data structure, we can’t traverse all the elements in a single run only.
Examples of non-linear data structures are trees and graphs. Types of Linked Lists:
Simple Linked List – In this type of linked list, one can move or traverse the linked list in only one direction. where the next pointer of each node points to other nodes but the next pointer of the last node points to NULL. It is also called “Singly Linked List”.
Doubly Linked List – In this type of linked list, one can move or traverse the linked list in both directions (Forward and Backward)
Circular Linked List – In this type of linked list, the last node of the linked list contains the link of the first/head node of the linked list in its next pointer.
Doubly Circular Linked List – A Doubly Circular linked list or a circular two-way linked list is a more complex type of linked list that contains a pointer to the next as well as the previous node in the sequence. The difference between the doubly linked and circular doubly list is the same as that between a singly linked list and a circular linked list. The circular doubly linked list does not contain null in the previous field of the first node.
Header Linked List – A header linked list is a special type of linked list that contains a header node at the beginning of the list. </p>
